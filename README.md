# Lab6

I wanted to keep my github orgnized and not have a separate CISC-3140 Labs repository, so instead of transferring it to RepoMeta, I stored it here. Also in this folder is How I created the Repository Called Repo from the command line. Then I transferred the file to the CISC-3140 folder by clone, and then I made another folder named LAB 6, which I transferred the Hello World to and edited.
